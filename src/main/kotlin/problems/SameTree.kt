 * Problem: Same Tree
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/
 *
 * Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
 * Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
 * Output: true
 *
 * @property p First binary tree root
 * @property q Second binary tree root
 * @return Boolean indicating if the trees are identical
 * @see TreeNode
