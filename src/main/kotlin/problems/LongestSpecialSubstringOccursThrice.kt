/**
 * Problem: Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice I
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-longest-special-substring-that-occurs-thrice-i/
 *
 * You are given a string s that consists of lowercase English letters.
 * A substring of s is called special if it contains only the same character.
 * Return the length of the longest special substring of s that occurs at least thrice,
 * or -1 if no special substring occurs at least thrice.
 *
 * A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "aaaa"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The longest special substring that occurs thrice is "aa": substrings "aa", "aa", and "aa".
 * It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 2.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "abcdef"
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: There exists no special substring that occurs thrice.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "abcaba"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The longest special substring that occurs thrice is "a": substrings "a", "a", and "a".
 * It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 1.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 3 <= s.length <= 50
 * - s consists of only lowercase English letters.
 *
 * @param s Input string
 * @return Length of longest special substring occurring thrice, or -1 if none exists
